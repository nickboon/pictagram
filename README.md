This code is part of the folowing proposal for work for an art exhibition:

David Bowie: "I don't think we've even seen the tip of the iceberg. I think the potential of what the Internet is going to do to society, both good and bad, is unimaginable. I think we're actually on the cusp of something exhilarating and terrifying."

Jeremy Paxman: "it's just a tool though, isn't it? [...] simply a different delivery system there, you're arguing for something more profound?"

David Bowie: "I'm talking about the actual context and the state of content is going to be so different to anything that we can really envisage at the moment where the interplay between the user and the provider will be so in simpatico that it is going to crush our ideas of what
mediums are all about. [...] The breakthroughs in the early part of the century with people like Duchamp were so prescient in what they were doing and putting down – the idea that the piece of work is not finished until the audience comes to it and adds their own interpretation, and what the piece of art is about is the grey space in the middle. That grey space in the middle is what the 21st century is going to be about.”

Previously I have built programs that generate imagery and published them as websites. While not peer to peer collaboration they have allowed commissions to be selected from a unique generation and/or using given parameters.
For NETWORK, in the spirit of promoting graphical communication and of stymying manipulative abuse of current social media, I have started a social media platform that allows it's users to communicate solely in Unicode symbols. I propose to print and exhibit this communication.
