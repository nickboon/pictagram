In the spirit of promoting graphical communication and of stymying manipulative abuse of current social media, I have started a social media platform that allows it's users to communicate solely in [Unicode symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode).

This formed the basis for work for the [Black Church Print Studio NETWORK exhibition](https://www.blackchurchprint.ie/network-exhibition/) at the launch of Print Network Ireland.
